<h1> <style=color:green> Hello world!</h1>
<p>My name is Alicia Naspretto. I am Graphic and Web Designer currently in Waco, Texas. I also have a lot of experience with videography and video editing. <br>
In recent days I've learned how to crochet and it's become one of my favorite hobbies! I also enjoy reading, yoga, painting, and spending time with my two dogs, Cannoli and Daisy. My family has also recently grown by three hermit crabs and I've really been enjoying watching them get accustomed to their new home. </p>
